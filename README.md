Here we will create our jump'n'run game! It is a project by Kassandra, Ruth and Leif, part of our course "Software Engineering" at the DHBW Karlsruhe.

This repository is only for the Android stuff, you will not find serverside related material around here.

## Project Vision

We plan on creating a simple mobile game for Android devices. Of course we know it is not easy to develope an app so we want to keep it simple. So we start with the easy tasks and expand it later.

We want to make an Arcade/ Jump’n’Run game, the game mechanic should be dodging obstacles. There are different levels which you can play and if you are a logged user you could find your name in the global highscore.

Additional features could be that you can wrote a message to other gamers, rate the different levels or collect points to get special prices.

At the moment leruka is our codename and when we have decided on a name for our app, we will let you know. :-)

As soon as the APP is stable and playable, we will put it on Google Play, so you can test it!
